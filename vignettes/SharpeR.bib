However, most of the existing results concern the simple case in which an investor has a one-month horizon and mean-variance preferences. In this paper, we examine whether this finding holds for longer investment horizons, when the asset menu includes bonds and real estate beyond stocks and cash, and when the investor is characterized by constant relative risk aversion preferences which are not locally mean-variance for long horizons. Our experiments indicates that power utility investors with horizons of one year and longer would have on average benefited, ex-post, from an optimizing strategy that exploits simple linear predictability in asset returns over the period January 1995 - December 2007. This result is insensitive to the degree of risk aversion, to the number of predictors being included in the forecasting model, and to the deduction of transaction costs from measured portfolio performance.},

	abstract={We describe the pension plan features of the states and the largest cities and counties in the U.S. Unlike in the private sector, defined benefit (DB) pensions are still the norm in the public sector. However, a few jurisdictions have shifted towards defined contribution (DC) plans as their primary savings plan, and fiscal pressures are likely to generate more movement in this direction. Holding fixed a public employee's work and salary history, we show that DB retirement income replacement ratios vary greatly across jurisdictions. This creates large variation in workers' need to save for retirement in other accounts. There is also substantial heterogeneity across jurisdictions in the savings generated in primary DC plans because of differences in the level of mandatory employer and employee contributions. One notable difference between public and private sector DC plans is that public sector primary DC plans are characterized by required employee or employer contributions (or both), whereas private sector plans largely feature voluntary employee contributions that are supplemented by an employer match. We conclude by applying lessons from savings behavior in private sector savings plans to the design of public sector plans.},

	abstract={\&quot;A sector model presented in this article, uses about 200 representative French cereal-oriented farms to estimate policy impacts by means of mathematical modeling. Usually, such models suppose that farmers intend to maximize expected gross margin. This rationality hypothesis however seems hardly justifiable, especially these days, when gross margin variability due to European Common Agricultural Policy changes may become significant. Increasing uncertainty introduces bounded rationality to the decision problem so that crop gross margins may be better approximated by interval rather than by expected (precise) values. The initial LP problem is specified as an â¿¿Interval Linear Programming (ILP)â¿. We assume that farmers tend to decide upon their surface allocation prudently in order to get through with minimum loss, which is precisely the rationale underlying the minimization of maximum regret decision criterion. Recent advances in operations research, namely Mausser and Laguna algorithms, are exploited to implement the min-max regret criterion to arable agriculture ILP. The validation against observed crop mix proved that as uncertainty increases about 40\% of the farmers adopt the min-max regret decision rule instead of the gross margin maximization.\&quot;},

The main indicators of this are a large current account deficit, a large federal budget deficit and trend-wise increasing costs of Social Security and Medicare. In this chapter, we will discuss these observations and to what extent the financial and economic crisis may have changed the outlook. Before this, we need to define what we mean by sustainability. An often used definition of sustainability is that the inter-temporal budget restriction is satisfied.},

	abstract={This paper provides comprehensive empirical evidence that supports the predictions of Sargent and Wallace\&apos;s \&ldquo;unpleasant monetarist arithmetic\&rdquo; that an increase in public debt is typically inflationary in countries with large public debt. Drawing on an extensive panel data set, we find that the relationship holds strongly in indebted developing countries, weakly in other developing countries, and generally does not hold in developed economies. These results are robust to the inclusion of other variables, corrections for endogeneity biases, relaxation of common-slope restrictions, and are invariant over subsample periods. We estimate a vector autoregression to trace out the transmission channel and find the impulse responses consistent with the predictions of a forward-looking model of inflation. Wealth effects of public debt could also affect inflation, as posited by the fiscal theory of the price level, but we do not find supportive evidence. The results suggest that the risk of a debt-inflation trap is significant in highly indebted countries and pure money-based stabilization is unlikely to be effective over the medium term. Our findings stress the importance of institutional and structural factors in the link between fiscal policy and inflation.

	abstract = {{Pseudoreplication is defined as the use of inferential statistics to test for treatment effects with data from experiments where either treatments are not replicated (though samples may be) or replicates are not statistically independent. In ANOVA terminology, it is the testing for treatment effects with an error term inappropriate to the hypothesis being considered. Scrutiny of 176 experimental studies published between 1960 and the present revealed that pseudoreplication occurred in 27 of them, or 48\% of all such studies that applied inferential statistics. The incidence of pseudoreplication is especially high in studies of marine benthos and small mammals. The critical features of controlled experimentation are reviewed. Nondemonic intrusion is defined as the impingement of chance events on an experiment in progress. As a safeguard against both it and preexisting gradients, interspersion of treatments is argued to be an obligatory feature of good design. Especially in small experiments, adequate interspersion can sometimes be assured only by dispensing with strict randomization procedures. Comprehension of this conflict between interspersion and randomization is aided by distinguishing pre-layout (or conventional) and layout-specific alpha (probability of type I error). Suggestions are offered to statisticians and editors of ecological journals as to how ecologists' understanding of experimental design and statistics might be improved.}},

	abstract={\&quot;The problem of estimation after selection can arise in many statistical applications. The intuitive estimator constructed as if there were no prior selection appears to be misleading. This is especially so when one is estimating the characteristic of the chosen population, selected to maximise estimates of the similar characteristics. In such a case, the intuitive estimator highly overestimate the chosen characteristic. The characteristic focussed here is the mean and a normal parametric assumption of the observations is made. The problem of improving upon the intuitive estimators appears to be technically very difficult. No alternative estimator has been proposed which was shown to dominate the intuitive estimator in any sense. We provide an empirical Bayes estimator which was shown to dominate the intuitive estimator in terms of Bayes risk with respect to any normal prior. Note that the frequentist risk domination is not possible. Numerical studies also provide strong evidence that the domination is robust with respect to independently identically distributed priors, not necessarily normal. the estimator does not overestimate the target parameter for many circumstances.\&quot;},

The t-test and linear regression compare the mean of an outcome variable for different subjects. While these are valid even in very small samples if the outcome variable is Normally distributed, their major usefulness comes from the fact that in large samples they are valid for any distribution. We demonstrate this validity by simulation in extremely non-Normal data. We discuss situations in which in other methods such as the Wilcoxon rank sum test and ordinal logistic regression (proportional odds model) have been recommended, and conclude that the t-test and linear regression often provide a convenient and practical alternative. The major limitation on the t-test and linear regression for inference about associations is not a distributional one, but whether detecting and estimating a difference in the mean of the outcome answers the scientific question at hand.

		Classical least squares (CLS) and partial least squares (PLS) are two common multivariate regression algorithms in chemometrics. This paper presents an asymptotically exact mathematical analysis of the mean squared error of prediction of CLS and PLS under the linear mixture model commonly assumed in spectroscopy. For CLS regression with a very large calibration set the root mean squared error is approximately equal to the noise per wavelength divided by the length of the net analyte signal vector. It is shown, however, that for a finite training set with n samples in p dimensions there are additional error terms that depend on sigma2p2/n2, where sigmais the noise level per co-ordinate. Therefore in the 'large p, small n' regime, common in spectroscopy, these terms can be quite large and even dominate the overall prediction error. It is demonstrated both theoretically and by simulations that dimensional reduction of the input data via their compact representation with a few features, selected for example by adaptive wavelet compression, can substantially decrease these effects and recover the asymptotic error. This analysis provides a theoretical justification for the need to perform feature selection (dimensional reduction) of the input data prior to application of multivariate regression algorithms.

	abstract = {A score-type statistic, T<sub>s</sub>, is introduced for testing H: ψ = 0 against K: ψ ≥ 0 and more general one-sided hypotheses when nuisance parameters may be present; ψ is a vector parameter. The main advantages of T<sub>s</sub> are that it requires estimation of the model only under the null hypothesis and that, it is asymptotically equivalent to the likelihood ratio statistic; these are precisely the reasons for the popularity of the score tests for testing against two-sided alternatives. In this sense, T<sub>s</sub> preserves the main attractive features of the classical two-sided score test. The theoretical results are presented in a general framework where the likelihood-based score function is replaced by an estimating function so that the test is applicable even if the exact population distribution is unknown. Computation of T<sub>s</sub> is simplified by the fact that it can be computed easily once the corresponding two-sided statistic has been computed. The relevance and simplicity of T<sub>s</sub> are illustrated by discussing a data example in detail. This example involves an autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity (ARCH) model, and the objective is to test for the presence of ARCH effect. The null and alternative hypotheses turn out to be of the form H: ψ = 0 and K: ψ ≥ 0 respectively where ψ is the vector of ARCH parameters. In contrast to the likelihood ratio and other equivalent forms that are currently available for testing against such one-sided hypotheses, we note the following: T<sub>s</sub> is convenient to apply, because the full ARCH model need not be estimated subject to the inequality constraint ψ ≥ 0 and we do not need to know the exact likelihood because T<sub>s</sub> is based on estimating equations rather than likelihoods.},

Shown to be asymptotically equivalent to Perlman's LRT, but to have different power in finite samples. Illustrates some differences graphically. As in Perlman's test, the weights of the chi-bar square which determine the survival function of the one-sided Hotelling statistic depend on the unknown covariance parameter. Also as in Perlman, the maximal value of the weights over all possible covariance matrices is taken to get a p-value, so the test can be very conservative. This has consequences for use in finance, since it implies some disconnect between the sample statistic and the underlying population parameters (and that disconnect changes character as the sample size increases). silvapulle_hotelling.pdf"

The measure was conceptually simple, easily calculated, and applicable to an entire investment portfolio, in contrast to the measures of Treynor and Jensen which measure only the undiversifiable risk in a portfolio. Sharpe's measure is still a frequently recommended tool for measuring portfolio performance. The measure is, however, biased. It is the purpose of this note to demonstrate the existence of the bias, indicate its size, and provide a means of correcting it. }

  abstract = {We study the sample estimation risk of the traditional Sharpe ratio without the restrictive assumption of normality for return series. We derive analytical results for the approximate bias and variance of the sample Sharpe ratio in terms of the underlying distribution parameters. The results clarify several misinterpretations existing in the literature. A Monte Carlo study shows that our bias and variance formulae approximate the true moments of the sample Sharpe ratio remarkably well. We propose using the analytical results to design an estimation risk-adjusted Sharpe ratio. An empirical study of mutual fund performance shows that using the adjusted Sharpe ratio gives a quite different performance ranking of those traditionally top-ranked funds.},

A modification of the t variable is obtained that is useful for distributions with skewness as severe as that of the exponential distribution. The procedure is generalized and applied to the jackknife t variable for a class of statistics with moments similar to those of the sample mean. Tests of the correlation coefficient obtained using this procedure are compared empirically with corresponding tests determined using Fisher's z transformation and the usual jackknife estimate.},

  abstract={ In finite population sampling, it has long been known that, for small sample sizes, when sampling from a skewed population, the usual frequentist intervals for the population mean cover the true value less often than their stated frequency of coverage. Recently, a non-informative Bayesian approach to some problems in finite population sampling has been developed, which is based on the 'Polya posterior'. For large sample sizes, these methods often closely mimic standard frequentist methods. In this paper, a modification of the 'Polya posterior', which employs the weighted Polya distribution, is shown to give interval estimators with improved coverage properties for problems with skewed populations and small sample sizes. This approach also yields improved tests for hypotheses about the mean of a skewed distribution.},

	abstract = {A confidence interval and test are obtained for the mean of an asymmetric distribution using a random sample of size n. The method is based on N. J. Johnson{\textquoteright}s (1978) modified t-test, where terms of Cornish-Fisher expansions involving the third moment are used to adjust the conventional statistic to have more closely a Student{\textquoteright}s t-distribution with n - 1 degrees of freedom. Johnson{\textquoteright}s (1978) test cannot be inverted uniquely, so a corresponding confidence interval for the mean may be disjointed. However, an artificial term of small order can be added to make inversion of the test a uniquely defined operation, which prevents such disjointedness. The resulting one-sided and two-sided intervals perform better than others in the literature with skewed distributions, and have good performance with a normal distribution. The two-sided interval may be recommended for general use if the sample size is 10 or more and the nominal confidence coefficient is 95\% or less, or if the sample size is 30 or more and the confidence coefficient is 99\% or less.

We show that this new uncertainty-adjusted investment skill metric (called Probabilistic Sharpe ratio, or PSR) has a number of important applications: First, it allows us to establish the track record length needed for rejecting the hypothesis that a measured Sharpe ratio is below a certain threshold with a given confidence level. Second, it models the trade-off between track record length and undesirable statistical features (e.g., negative skewness with positive excess kurtosis). Third, it explains why track records with those undesirable traits would benefit from reporting performance with the highest sampling frequency such that the IID assumption is not violated. Fourth, it permits the computation of what we call the Sharpe ratio Efficient Frontier (SEF), which lets us optimize a portfolio under non-Normal, leveraged returns while incorporating the uncertainty derived from track record length. Results can be validated using the Python code in the Appendix.}},

 abstract = {The expected market return is a number frequently required for the solution of many investment and corporate finance problems, but by comparison with other financial variables, there has been little research on estimating this expected return. Current practice for estimating the expected market return adds the historical average realized excess market returns to the Current observed interest rate. While this model explicitly reflects the dependence of the market return on the interest rate, it fails to account for the effect of changes in the level of market risk. Three models of equilibrium expected market returns which reflect this dependence are analyzed in this paper. Estimation procedures which incorporate the prior restriction that equilibrium expected excess returns on the market must be positive are derived and applied to return data for the period 1926- 1978. The principal conclusions from this exploratory investigation are: (1) in estimating models of the expected market return, the non-negativity restriction of the expected excess return should be explicitly included as part of the specification; (2) estimators which use realized returns should be adjusted for heteroscedasticity.},

	abstract={This thesis revisits the portfolio selection problem in cases where returns cannot be modeled as Gaussian. The emphasis is on the development of financially intuitive and statistically sound approaches to portfolio risk minimization. When returns exhibit asymmetry, we propose using a quantile-based measure of risk which we call shortfall. Shortfall is related to Value-at-Risk and Conditional Value-at-Risk, and can be tuned to capture tail risk. We formulate the sample shortfall minimization problem as a linear program. Using results from empirical process theory, we derive a central limit theorem for the shortfall portfolio estimator. We warn about the statistical pitfalls of portfolio selection based on the minimization of rare events, which happens to be the case when shortfall is tuned to focus on extreme tail risk. In the presence of heavy tails and tail dependence, we show that portfolios based on the minimization of alternative robust measures of risk may in fact have lower variance than those based on the minimization of sample variance. We show that minimizing the sample mean absolute deviation yields portfolios that are asymptotically more efficient than those based on the minimization of the sample variance, when returns have a multivariate Student-t distribution with degrees of freedom less than or equal to 6. This motivates our consideration of other robust measures of risk, for which we present linear and quadratic programming formulations.(cont.) We carry out experiments on simulated and historical data, illustrating the fact that the efficiency gained by considering robust measures of risk may be substantial. Finally, when the number of return observations is of the same order of magnitude as, or smaller than, the dimension of the portfolio being estimated, we investigate the applicability of regularization to sample risk minimization. We examine both L1- and L2-regularization. We interpret regularization from a Bayesian perspective, and provide an algorithm for choosing the regularization parameter. We validate the use of regularization in portfolio selection on simulated and historical data, and conclude that regularization can yield portfolios with smaller risk, and in particular smaller variance.},

A simple time series model designed to capture this dependence is presented. The model is an extension of the Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedastic (ARCH) and Generalized ARCH (GARCH) models obtained by allowing for conditionally t-distributed errors. The model can be derived as a simple subordinate stochastic process by including an additive unobservable error term in the conditional variance equation. The descriptive validity of the model is illustrated for a set of foreign exchange rates and stock price indices.},

 abstract = {GARCH models have been applied in modelling the relation between conditional variance and asset risk premia. These models, however, have at least three major drawbacks in asset pricing applications: (i) Researchers beginning with Black (1976) have found a negative correlation between current returns and future returns volatility. GARCH models rule this out by assumption. (ii) GARCH models impose parameter restrictions that are often violated by estimated coefficients and that may unduly restrict the dynamics of the conditional variance process. (iii) Interpreting whether shocks to conditional variance "persist" or not is difficult in GARCH models, because the usual norms measuring persistence often do not agree. A new form of ARCH is proposed that meets these objections. The method is used to estimate a model of the risk premium on the CRSP Value-Weighted Market Index from 1962 to 1987.},
