\begin{abstract}%FOLDUP
The SharpeR package provides basic functionality for testing significance of
the \txtSR of a series of returns, and of the Markowitz portfolio on a 
number of possibly correlated assets.\cite{Sharpe:1966} The goal of the package
is to make it simple to estimate profitability (in terms of risk-adjusted
returns) of strategies or asset streams.
\end{abstract}%UNFOLD

\section{The \txtSR and Optimal \txtSR}%FOLDUP
Sharpe defined the `reward to variability ratio', now known as the 
`\txtSR', as the sample statistic
$$
\ssr = \frac{\smu}{\ssig},
$$
where \smu is the sample mean, and \ssig is the sample standard deviation.
\cite{Sharpe:1966} The
\txtSR was later redefined to include a `risk-free' or `disastrous rate
of return': $\ssr = \wrapParens{\smu - \rfr}/\ssig.$ 

It is little appreciated in quantitative finance that the \txtSR is identical 
to the sample statistic proposed by Gosset in 1908 to test for zero mean
when the variance is unknown.  \cite{student08ttest} The `\tstat-test' we know
today, which includes an adjustment for sample size, was formulated later
by Fisher.  \cite{Fisher1925} Knowing that the \txtSR is related to the 
\tstat-statistic provides a `natural arbitrage,' since the latter has 
been extensively studied.  Many of the interesting properties of the
\tstat-statistic can be translated to properties about the \txtSR. 

Also little appreciated is that the multivariate analogue of the \tstat-statistic,
Hotelling's \Tstat, is related to the Markowitz portfolio. Consider the
following portfolio optimization problem:
\begin{equation}
\max_{\sportw : \qform{\svsig}{\sportw} \le R^2} 
\frac{\trAB{\sportw}{\svmu} - \rfr}{\sqrt{\qform{\svsig}{\sportw}}},
\label{eqn:port_prob}
\end{equation}
where \svmu, \svsig are the sample mean vector and covariance matrix, \rfr is
the risk-free rate, and $R$ is a cap on portfolio `risk' as estimated by
\svsig. (Note this differs from the traditional definition of the problem which
imposes a `self-financing constraint' which does not actually bound portfolio
weights.)  The solution to this problem is
$$
\sportwopt \defeq \frac{R}{\sqrt{\qform{\minv{\svsig}}{\svmu}}} \minv{\svsig}\svmu.
$$
The \txtSR of this portfolio is 
\begin{equation}
\ssropt 
\defeq \frac{\trAB{\sportwopt}{\svmu} - \rfr}{\sqrt{\qform{\svsig}{\sportwopt}}} 
= \sqrt{\qform{\minv{\svsig}}{\svmu}} - \frac{\rfr}{R}
= \sqrt{\Tstat / \ssiz} - \frac{\rfr}{R},
\label{eqn:ssr_uncons}
\end{equation}
where \Tstat is Hotelling's statistic, and \ssiz is the number of independent 
observations (\eg `days') used to construct \svmu. The term $\rfr / R$ is a
deterministic `drag' term that merely shifts the location of \ssropt, and so
we can (mostly) ignore it when testing significance of \ssropt.

Under the (typically indefensible) assumptions that the returns are generated
\iid from a normal distribution (multivariate normal in the case of the
portfolio problem), the distributions of \ssr and \ssrsqopt are known, and
depend on the sample size and the population analogues, \psr and \psnrsqopt.
In particular, they are distributed as rescaled non-central \tlaw{} and \flaw{}
distributions. Under these assumptions on the generating processes, we can
perform inference on the population analogues using the sample statistics.

The importance of each of these assumptions (\viz homoskedasticity,
independence, normality, \etc) can and should be checked. 
\cite{Lumley:2002,Opdyke2007} 
The reader must be warned that this package is distributed without any warranty
of any kind, and in no way should any analysis performed with this package be
interpreted as implicit investment advice by the author(s).

The units of \smu are `returns per time,' while those of \ssig are `returns per
square root time.' Consequently, the units of \ssr are `per square root time.'
Typically the \txtSR is quoted in `annualized' terms, \ie \yrto{-1/2}, but the
units are omitted. I believe that units should be included as it avoids
ambiguity, and simplifies conversions.

There is no clear standard whether arithmetic or geometric returns should be
used in the computation of the \txtSR. Since arithmetic returns are always
greater than the equivalent geometric returns, one would suspect that
arithmetic returns are \emph{always} used when advertising products. However, I
suspect that geometric returns are more frequently used in the analysis of
strategies. Geometric returns have the attractive property of being `additive',
meaning that the geometric return of a period is the sum of those of
subperiods, and thus the sign of the arithmetic mean of some geometric returns
indicates whether the final value of a strategy is greater than the initial
value. Oddly, the arithmetic mean of arithmetic returns does not share this
property. 

On the other hand, arithmetic returns are indeed additive 
\emph{contemporaneously}: if \vreti is the vector of arithmetic returns of
several stocks, and \sportw is the dollar proportional allocation into those
stocks at the start of the period, then \trAB{\vreti}{\sportw} is the
arithmetic return of the portfolio over that period. This holds even when the
portfolio holds some stocks `short.'  Often this portfolio accounting is
misapplied to geometric returns without even an appeal to Taylor's theorem.

For more details on the \txtSR and portfolio optimization, see the 
vignette, ``Statistics of the \txtSR'' distributed with this package.

\section{Using the \Robject{sr} Class}%FOLDUP

An \Robject{sr} object encapsulates one or more \txtSR statistics, along with the
degrees of freedom, the rescaling to a \tstat statistic, and the annualization
and units information. One can simply stuff this information into an \Robject{sr} 
object, but it is more straightforward to allow \Rfunction{as.sr} to compute the
\txtSR for you. 

<<'babysteps'>>=
library(SharpeR)
# suppose you computed the Sharpe of your strategy to
# be 1.3 / sqrt(yr), based on 1200 daily observations.
# store them as follows:
my.sr <- sr(sr=1.3,df=1200-1,ope=252,epoch="yr")
print(my.sr)
# multiple strategies can be tracked as well.
# one can attach names to them.
srstats <- c(0.5,1.2,0.6)
dim(srstats) <- c(3,1)
rownames(srstats) <- c("strat. A","strat. B","benchmark")
my.sr <- sr(srstats,df=1200-1,ope=252,epoch="yr")
print(my.sr)
@

Throughout, \Rcode{ope} stands for `Observations Per Epoch', and is the
(average) number of returns observed per the annualization period, called
the \Rcode{epoch}.  At the moment there is not much hand holding regarding
these parameters: no checking is performed for sane values.

The \Rfunction{as.sr} method will compute the \txtSR for you, from numeric,
\Robject{data.frame}, \Robject{xts} or \Robject{lm} objects. In the latter case, it
is assumed one is performing an attribution model, and the statistic of
interest is the fit of the \Rcode{(Intercept)} term divided by the residual
standard deviation. Here are some examples:

<<'showoff'>>=
set.seed(as.integer(charToRaw("set the seed")))
# Sharpe's 'model': just given a bunch of returns.
returns <- rnorm(253*8,mean=3e-4,sd=1e-2)
asr <- as.sr(returns,ope=253,epoch="yr")
print(asr)
# a data.frame with a single strategy
asr <- as.sr(data.frame(my.strategy=returns),ope=253,epoch="yr")
print(asr)
@

When a \Robject{data.frame} with multiple columns is given, the \txtSR of each is
computed, and they are all stored:
<<'more_data_frame'>>=
# a data.frame with multiple strategies
asr <- as.sr(data.frame(strat1=rnorm(253*8),strat2=rnorm(253*8,mean=4e-4,sd=1e-2)),
	ope=253,epoch="yr")
print(asr)
@

Here is an example using \Robject{xts} objects. In this case, if the \Rcode{ope}
is not given, it is inferred from the time marks of the input object.
<<'stock_loading',eval=FALSE,echo=TRUE>>=
require(quantmod)
# get price data, compute log returns on adjusted closes
get.ret <- function(sym,warnings=FALSE,...) {
	# getSymbols.yahoo will barf sometimes; do a trycatch

	while (!exists("OHCLV") && (trynum < 7)) {
		trynum <- trynum + 1
		try(OHLCV <- getSymbols(sym,auto.assign=FALSE,warnings=warnings,...),silent=TRUE)
  }
	adj.names <- paste(c(sym,"Adjusted"),collapse=".",sep="")
	if (adj.names %in% colnames(OHLCV)) {
		adj.close <- OHLCV[,adj.names]
	} else {
		# for DJIA from FRED, say. 
		adj.close <- OHLCV[,sym]
	}
	rm(OHLCV)
	# rename it
	colnames(adj.close) <- c(sym)
	adj.close <- adj.close[!is.na(adj.close)]
	lrets <- diff(log(adj.close))

	fname <- system.file('extdata','ret_data.rda',package='SharpeR')
	if (fname == "") {
		fname <- 'ret_data.rda'
	}
	# poofs all.ret here
	load(fname)
	sub.data <- all.ret[paste(from,to,sep="::"),colnames(all.ret) %in% syms]
	return(sub.data)
}
@
<<'helper_function'>>=
require(quantmod)
# quantmod::periodReturn does not deal properly with multiple
# columns, and the straightforward apply(mtms,2,periodReturn) barfs
my.periodReturn <- function(mtms,...) {
	per.rets <- do.call(cbind,lapply(mtms,
		function(x) {
			retv <- periodReturn(x,...)
			colnames(retv) <- colnames(x)
			return(retv) 
		}))
}
# convert log return to mtm, ignoring NA
lr2mtm <- function(x,...) {
	x[is.na(x)] = 0
	exp(cumsum(x))
}
@
<<'some_stocks'>>=
some.rets <- get.rets(c("IBM","AAPL","XOM"),
	from="2007-01-01",to="2013-01-01")
print(as.sr(some.rets))
@

The annualization of an \Robject{sr} object can be changed with the
\Rfunction{reannualize} method. The name of the epoch and the observation rate can
both be changed. Changing the annualization will not change statistical
significance, it merely changes the units.

<<'reannualize'>>=
yearly <- as.sr(some.rets[,"XOM"])
monthly <- reannualize(yearly,new.ope=21,new.epoch="mo.")
print(yearly)
# significance should be the same, but units changed.
print(monthly)
@

\subsection{Attribution Models}%FOLDUP

When an object of class \Robject{lm} is given to \Rfunction{as.sr}, the 
fit \Rcode{(Intercept)} term is divided by the residual volatility to compute
something like the \txtSR. In terms of Null Hypothesis Significance Testing,
nothing is gained by summarizing the \Robject{sr} object instead of the
\Robject{lm} object. However, confidence intervals on the \txtSR are quoted in
the more natural units of reward to variability, and in annualized terms (or
whatever the epoch is.)

As an example, here I perform a CAPM attribution to the monthly returns of
\StockTicker{AAPL}. Note that the statistical significance here is certainly
tainted by selection bias, a topic beyond the scope of this note.

<<'AAPL'>>=
# get the returns (see above for the function)
aapl.rets <- get.rets(c("AAPL","SPY"),from="2003-01-01",to="2013-01-01")
# make them monthly:
mo.rets <- my.periodReturn(lr2mtm(aapl.rets),period='monthly',type='arithmetic')
rm(aapl.rets)  # cleanup
# look at both of them together:
both.sr <- as.sr(mo.rets)
print(both.sr)
# confindence intervals on the Sharpe:
print(confint(both.sr))
# perform a CAPM attribution, using SPY as 'the market'
linmod <- lm(AAPL ~ SPY,data=mo.rets)
# convert attribution model to Sharpe
CAPM.sr <- as.sr(linmod,ope=both.sr$ope,epoch="yr")
# statistical significance does not change (though note the sr summary
# prints a 1-sided p-value)
print(summary(linmod))
print(CAPM.sr)
# the confidence intervals tell the same story, but in different units:
print(confint(linmod,'(Intercept)'))
print(confint(CAPM.sr))
@
%UNFOLD

\subsection{Testing Sharpe and Power}%FOLDUP

The function \Rfunction{sr\_test} performs one- and two-sample tests for
significance of \txtSR. Paired tests for equality of \txtSR can be
performed via the \Rfunction{sr\_equality\_test}, which applies the tests of Leung \etal or
of Wright \etal \cite{Leung2008,Wright2012}

<<'SPDRcheck'>>=
# get the sector 'spiders'
secto.rets <- get.rets(c("XLY","XLE","XLP","XLF","XLV","XLI","XLB","XLK","XLU"),
	from="2003-01-01",to="2013-01-01")
# make them monthly:
mo.rets <- my.periodReturn(lr2mtm(secto.rets),period='monthly',type='arithmetic')
# one-sample test on utilities:
XLU.monthly <- mo.rets[,"XLU"]
print(sr_test(XLU.monthly),alternative="two.sided")

# test for equality of Sharpe among the different spiders
print(sr_equality_test(secto.rets))
# perform a paired two-sample test via sr_test:
XLF.monthly <- mo.rets[,"XLF"]
print(sr_test(x=XLU.monthly,y=XLF.monthly,ope=12,paired=TRUE))
@

The \emph{power} of the one-sample test for \txtSR follows a form first
published by Johnson and Welch:\cite{Johnson:1940}
$$
\ssiz = \frac{c}{\psnrsq},
$$
where the constant $c$ depends on the type I and type II rates and whether one
is performing a one- or two-sided test. A handy mnemonic instantiation of this
rule, similar to `Lehr's rule,' \cite{vanBelle2002_STRUTs,Lehr16} is 
$e \approx \ssiz \psnrsq$, where \psnr is the population signal-to-noise
ratio, $e$ is Euler's number, and \ssiz is the sample size, in the \emph{same
units} as \psnr. That is, if one measures SNR in annualized units, then \ssiz is
the number of \emph{years}.  The relative error in this approximation for
determining the sample size is shown in \figref{power_thing}, as a function of
\psnr; the error is smaller than one percent in the tested range.  Note that
Euler's number appears here coincidentally, as it is nearly equal to
$\wrapBracks{\funcit{\minv{\Phi}}{0.95}}^2$.

<<'power_thing',fig.cap="The percent error of the power mnemonic $e\\approx\\ssiz \\psnrsq$ is plotted versus \\psnr.",fig.height=4,fig.width=5>>=
ope <- 253
 zetas <- seq(0.1,2.5,length.out=51)
ssizes <- sapply(zetas,function(zed) { 
 x <- power.sr_test(n=NULL,zeta=zed,sig.level=0.05,power=0.5,ope=ope)
 x$n / ope 
})
plot(zetas,100 * ((exp(1) / zetas^2) - ssizes)/ssizes, ylab="error in mnemonic rule (as %)")
@

<<'sobering',include=FALSE>>=
foo.power <- power.sr_test(n=253,zeta=NULL,sig.level=0.05,power=0.5,ope=253)
@

The power rules are sobering indeed. Suppose you were a hedge fund manager
whose investors threatened to perform a one-sided \tstat-test after one year.
If your strategy's signal-to-noise ratio is less than
\Sexpr{foo.power$zeta}\yrto{-1/2} (a value which should be considered ``very good''), 
your chances of `passing' the \tstat-test are less than fifty percent.

\section{Using the \Robject{sropt} Class}%FOLDUP

The class \Robject{sropt} stores the `optimal' \txtSR, which is that of the
optimal (`Markowitz') portfolio, as defined in \eqnref{port_prob}, as well as
the relevant degrees of freedom, and the annualization parameters. Again, the
constructor can be used directly, but the helper function is preferred:

<<'sropt_basics'>>=
# from a matrix object:
ope <- 253
n.stok <- 7
n.yr <- 8
# somewhat unrealistic: independent returns.
rand.rets <- matrix(rnorm(n.yr * ope * n.stok),ncol=n.stok)
asro <- as.sropt(rand.rets,ope=ope)
rm(rand.rets)
print(asro)
# from an xts object
asro <- as.sropt(some.rets)
print(asro)
@

One can compute confidence intervals for the population parameter
$\psnropt \defeq \sqrt{\qform{\minv{\pvsig}}{\pvmu}}$, called the `optimal
signal-noise ratio', based on inverting the non-central \flaw{}-distribution. 
Estimates of \psnropt can also be computed, via Maximum Likelihood
Estimation, or a `shrinkage' estimate.  \cite{kubokawa1993estimation,MC1986216}

<<'sropt_estim'>>=
# confidence intervals:
print(confint(asro,level.lo=0.05,level.hi=1))
# estimation
print(inference(asro,type="KRS"))
print(inference(asro,type="MLE"))
@

A nice rule of thumb is that, to a first order approximation, the MLE of
\psnropt is zero exactly when $\ssrsqopt \le \nlatf/\ssiz,$ where
\nlatf is the number of assets. \cite{kubokawa1993estimation,MC1986216}
Inspection of this inequality confirms that
\ssropt and \ssiz can be expressed `in the same units', meaning that if \ssropt
is in \yrto{-1/2}, then \ssiz should be the number of \emph{years}.  For
example, if the Markowitz portfolio on 8 assets over 7 years has a 
\txtSR of 1\yrto{-1/2}, the MLE will be zero. This can be confirmed empirically
as below.

<<'MLE_rule'>>=
ope <- 253
zeta.s <- 0.8
n.check <- 1000
df1 <- 10
df2 <- 6 * ope
rvs <- rsropt(n.check,df1,df2,zeta.s,ope,drag=0)
roll.own <- sropt(z.s=rvs,df1,df2,drag=0,ope=ope,epoch="yr")
MLEs <- inference(roll.own,type="MLE")
zerMLE <- MLEs <= 0
crit.value <- 0.5 * (max(rvs[zerMLE])^2 + min(rvs[!zerMLE])^2)
aspect.ratio <- df1 / (df2 / ope)
cat(sprintf("empirical cutoff for zero MLE is %2.2f yr^{-1}\n", crit.value))
cat(sprintf("the aspect ratio is %2.2f yr^{-1}\n",aspect.ratio))
@

\subsection{The Haircut}%FOLDUP

Care must be taken interpreting the confidence intervals and the estimated
optimal SNR. This is because \psnropt is the \emph{maximal} population 
SNR achieved by any portfolio; it is at least equal to, and potentially much
larger than, the SNR achieved by the portfolio based on sample statistics,
\sportwopt. There is a gap or `haircut' due to mis-estimation of the optimal
portfolio. One would suspect that this gap is worse when the true effect size
(\ie \psnropt) is smaller, when there are fewer observations (\ssiz), and when
there are more assets (\nlatf).

Assuming \pvmu is not all zeros, define the haircut as the quantity
\begin{equation}
\hcut \defeq 1 - \frac{1}{\psnropt}\frac{\trAB{\sportwopt}{\pvmu}}{\sqrt{\qform{\pvsig}{\sportwopt}}}
= 1 - \wrapParens{\frac{\trAB{\sportwopt}{\pvmu}}{\trAB{\pportwopt}{\pvmu}}}
\wrapParens{\frac{\sqrt{\qform{\pvsig}{\pportwopt}}}{\sqrt{\qform{\pvsig}{\sportwopt}}}},
\label{eqn:hcut_def}
\end{equation}
where \pportwopt is the population optimal portfolio, positively proportional
to $\minv{\pvsig}{\pvmu}.$ Thus the haircut is one minus the ratio of 
population SNR achieved by the sample Markowitz portfolio to the 
optimal population SNR (which is achieved by the population Markowitz
portfolio). A smaller value means that the sample portfolio achieves
a larger proportion of possible SNR, or, equivalently, a larger value of
the haircut means greater mis-estimation of the optimal portfolio.
The haircut takes values in $\wrapBracks{0,2}$.

Modeling the haircut is not straightforward
because it is a random quantity which is not observed. That is, it mixes the
unknown population parameters \pvsig and \pvmu with the sample quantity
\sportwopt, which is random. 

When $\ssiz/\nlatf$ is large, the following is a reasonable approximation to
the distribution of \hcut:
\begin{equation}  
\sqrt{\nlatf - 1} \ftan{\farcsin{1-\hcut}} \approx
\nctlaw{\sqrt{\ssiz}\psnropt,\nlatf-1},
\label{eqn:hcut_apx}
\end{equation}
where \nctlaw{x,y} is a non-central \tstat-distribution with non-centrality
parameter $x$ and $y$ degrees of freedom.
This approximation can be found by ignoring all variability in the sample
estimate of the covariance matrix, that is by assuming that the sample optimal
portfolio was computed with the \emph{population} covariance:
$\sportwopt \propto \minv{\pvsig}{\svmu}$. Because mis-estimation of the
covariance matrix should contribute some error, I expect that this
approximation is a `stochastic lower bound' on the true haircut. Numerical
simulations, however, suggest it is a fairly tight bound for large $\ssiz/\nlatf$.
(I would be willing to guess that the true distribution involves a non-central
\flaw{}-distribution, but the proof is beyond me at the moment.)

%Numerical experiments support the following as an approximation to
%the median value of the haircut distribution:
%$$
%1 - \fsin{\farctan{\frac{\sqrt{\ssiz}\psnropt}{\sqrt{\nlatf-1}}}}.
%$$

Here I look at the haircut via Monte Carlo simulations:

I check the quality of the approximation given in \eqnref{hcut_apx} by a Q-Q 
plot in \figref{haircutting}.  For the case where
$\ssiz=\Sexpr{n.obs}$ (\Sexpr{n.yr} years of daily observations), 
$\nlatf=\Sexpr{n.stok}$ and $\psnropt=\Sexpr{zeta.s * sqrt(ope)}\yrto{-1/2}$, 
the t-approximation is very good indeed. 
%Note that computing prediction
%intervals for this unobserved, random quantity using this equation is not
%feasible because it relies on the unobserved \psnropt.  Using a plugin

%Continuing, 
%In this case, where we optimize over \Sexpr{n.stok} assets given \Sexpr{n.yr} 
%years of daily observations, and a population SNR of 
%\Sexpr{zeta.s * sqrt(ope)} \yrto{-1/2}, 
The median value of the haircut is on the 
order of \Sexpr{signif(100 * medv.true,2)}\%, meaning that the median
population SNR of the sample portfolios is around \Sexpr{med.snr.true *
sqrt(ope)}\yrto{-1/2}.  The maximum value of the haircut over the
\Sexpr{n.sim} simulations, however is \Sexpr{max(hcuts)}, which is larger than
one; this happens if and only if the sample portfolio has negative expected
return: $\trAB{\sportwopt}{\pvmu} < 0$. In this case the Markowitz portfolio
is actually \emph{destroying value} because of modeling error: the mean return
of the selected portfolio is negative, even though positive mean is achievable.

%Again, it is not clear how to estimate the haircut given the observed
%statistics \svmu and \svsig, other than lamely `plugging in' the sample
%estimate in place of \psnropt.

The approximation in \eqnref{hcut_apx} involves the unknown population
parameters \pvmu and \pvsig, but does not make use of the observed quantities
\svmu and \svsig. It seems mostly of theoretical interest, perhaps for
producing prediction intervals on \hcut when planning a trading strategy 
(\ie balancing \ssiz and \nlatf). A more practical problem is that of 
estimating confidence intervals on 
$\trAB{\sportw}{\pvmu} / \sqrt{\qform{\minv{\pvsig}}{\sportw}}$ having 
observed \svmu and \svsig. In this case one \emph{cannot} simply 
plug-in some estimate of \psnropt computed from \ssropt (via MLE, KRS, \etc)
into \eqnref{hcut_apx}. The reason is that the error in the approximation of
\psnropt is not independent of the modeling error that causes the haircut.

\subsection{Approximating Overfit}

A high-level sketch of quant work is as follows: 
construct a trading system with some free parameters, \stratrc, backtest the strategy for
$\stratrc[1],\stratrc[2],\ldots,\stratrc[m]$, then pick the \stratrc[i] that
maximizes the \txtSR in backtesting. `Overfit bias' (variously known as `datamining
bias,' `garbatrage,' `backtest arb,' \etc) is the upward bias in one's estimate
of the true signal-to-noise of the strategy parametrized by \stratrc[i^*] due
to one using the same data to select the strategy and estimate it's
performance. \cite{Aronson2007}[Chapter 6]

As an example, consider a basic Moving Average Crossover strategy. Here
\stratrc is a vector of 2 window lengths. One longs the market exactly when one
moving average exceeds the other, and shorts otherwise. One performs
a brute force search of all allowable window sizes. Before deciding to deploy
money into the MAC strategy parametrized by \stratrc[i^*], one has to estimate
its profitability.

There is a way to roughly estimate overfit bias by viewing the problem as a
portfolio problem, and performing inference on the optimal \txtSR.  To do
this, suppose that \vreti[i] is the \ssiz-vector of backtested returns
associated with \stratrc[i]. (I will assume that all the backtests are over the
same period of time.)  Then approximately embed the backtested returns vectors
in the subset of a \nlatf-dimensional subspace. That is, by a process like PCA,
make the approximation:
%A(?): Make PCA-like linear approximation of returns vectors:
%$$\wrapNeBraces{\vreti[1],\ldots,\vreti[m]} \approx \mathcal{L} \subset \setwo{\sum_{1\le j \le \nlatf} k_j \vretj[j]}{k_j \in \reals}$$
$$\wrapNeBraces{\vreti[1],\ldots,\vreti[m]} \approx \mathcal{K} \subset \mathcal{L} \defeq \setwo{\mretj \sportw}{\sportw \in \reals{\nlatf}}$$
Abusing notation, let $\funcit{\ssr}{\stratrc}$ be the sample \txtSR
associated with parameters \stratrc, and also let $\funcit{\ssr}{\vreti}$ be the \txtSR
associated with the vector of returns \vreti.  Then make the approximation
$$
\funcit{\ssr}{\stratrc[*]} \defeq \max_{\stratrc[1],\ldots,\stratrc[m]}
\funcit{\ssr}{\stratrc[i]} 
\approx \max_{\vreti \in \mathcal{K}} \funcit{\ssr}{\vreti}
\le \max_{\vreti \in \mathcal{L}} \funcit{\ssr}{\vreti} = \ssropt.
$$
This is a conservative approximation: the true maximum over $\mathcal{L}$ is
presumably much larger than \funcit{\ssr}{\stratrc[*]}. One can then use 
\funcit{\ssr}{\stratrc[*]} as \ssropt over a set of \nlatf assets, perform
inference on \psnropt, which, by a series of approximations as above, is an
approximate upper bound on \funcit{\psnr}{\stratrc[*]}.

This approximate attack on overfitting will work better when one has a good
estimate of \nlatf, when $m$ is relatively large and \nlatf relatively small,
and when the linear approximation to the set of backtested returns is good.
Moreover, the definition of $\mathcal{L}$ explicitly allows shorting, whereas
the backtested returns vectors $\vreti[i]$ may lack the symmetry about zero 
to make this a good approximation. By way of illustration, consider the case
where the trading system is set up such that different \stratrc produce 
minor variants on a clearly losing strategy: in this case we might have
$\funcit{\ssr}{\stratrc[*]} < 0$, which cannot hold for \ssropt. 

One can estimate \nlatf via Monte Carlo simulations, by actually performing
PCA, or via the `SWAG' method. Surprisingly, often one's intuitive estimate 
of the true `degrees of freedom' in a trading system is reasonably good.

Here I illustrate the quality of the approximation for the two-window 
simple MAC strategy. I generate log returns which are homoskedastic, driftless,
and have zero autocorrelation. In this case, \emph{every} MAC strategy has zero
expected return (ignoring trading costs). In spite of this deficiency in the
market, I find the best combination of window sizes by looking at \Sexpr{n.yr} 
years of daily data. By selecting the combination of windows with the highest
\txtSR, then using that maximal value as an estimate of the selected model's
true signal-noise-ratio, I have subjected myself to overfit bias. I repeat this
experiment \Sexpr{n.sim} times, then Q-Q plot the maximal \txtSR values over
those experiments versus an optimal \txtSR distribution assuming $\nlatf=2$ in
\figref{estimate_overfit}.  The fit is reasonable\footnote{And much better 
when the overfitting is more aggressive, which takes more processing time 
to simulate.} except in the case where the
maximal in-sample \txtSR is very low (recall that it can be negative for this
brute-force search, whereas the optimal \txtSR distribution does not produce
negative values). This case is unlikely to lead to a trading catastrophe,
however.

It behooves me to replicate the above experiment `under the alternative,' \eg
when the market has autocorrelated returns, to see if the approximation holds
up when $\psnropt > 0$. I leave this for future iterations.
Instead, I apply the $\nlatf=2$ approximation to the brute-force MAC overfit on
\StockTicker{SPY}. 

<<'now_on_spy'>>=
# is MAC on SPY significant?
SPY.lret <- get.rets(c('SPY'),from="2003-01-01",to="2013-01-01")
# oops! there might be NAs in there!
mysr <- as.sr(SPY.lret,na.rm=TRUE)  # just to get the ope
print(mysr)
# get rid of NAs
SPY.lret[is.na(SPY.lret)] <- 0
# try a whole lot of windows:
win1 <- seq(4,204,by=10)
zeds <- brute.force(SPY.lret,win1=win1)
SPY.MAC.asro <- sropt(z.s=zeds,df1=2,df2=length(SPY.lret) - max(win1),ope=mysr$ope)
print(SPY.MAC.asro)
print(inference(SPY.MAC.asro,type="KRS"))
@

The \txtSR for \StockTicker{SPY} over this period is \Sexpr{mysr$sr}\yrto{-1/2}. The
optimal \txtSR for the tested MAC strategies is \Sexpr{SPY.MAC.asro$sropt}\yrto{-1/2}. 
The KRS estimate (using the $\nlatf=2$ approximation) for the upper bound on 
signal-to-noise of the optimal MAC strategy is 
only \Sexpr{inference(SPY.MAC.asro,type="KRS")}\yrto{-1/2}. \cite{kubokawa1993estimation}
This leaves little room for excitement about MAC strategies on
\StockTicker{SPY}.

\section{Distribution Functions}%FOLDUP

There are \Rcode{dpqr} functions for the \txtSR distribution, as well as the
`optimal \txtSR' distribution. These are merely rescaled non-central 
\tstat and \Fstat distributions, provided for convenience, and for testing
purposes. See the help for \Rfunction{dsr} and \Rfunction{dsropt} for more details.

\section{Hypothesis Tests}%FOLDUP

The function \Rfunction{sr\_equality\_test}, implements the 
tests of Leung \etal and of Wright \etal for testing the equality 
of \txtSR. \cite{Leung2008,Wright2012} I have found that these tests
(or my implementation thereof!) apparently reject the null 
`for the wrong reason'.

Here I confirm that the tests give approximately uniform p-values under
the null in three situations: when stock returns are independent Gaussians, 
when they are independent and \tlaw{}-distributed, and when they are Gaussian
and correlated. Visual confirmation is via \figref{sr_eq_test_normal} through
\figref{sr_eq_test_correlated}, showing Q-Q plots against uniformity of the
putative p-values in Monte Carlo simulations with data drawn from the null.

As a followup, I consider the case where the returns are those of several
randomly generated market-timing strategies which are always fully invested
long or short in the market, with equal probability.  I look at \Sexpr{n.sim}
simulations of \Sexpr{n.co} random market timing strategies rebalancing weekly
on a 10 year history of \StockTicker{SPY}.  
The 'p-values' from \Rfunction{sr\_equality\_test} applied to the returns are
Q-Q plotted against uniformity in \figref{sr_eq_test_mtime}. The type I rate of
this test is far larger than the nominal rate: it is rejecting for
`uninteresting reasons'.  I suspect this test breaks down because of small
sample size or small 'aspect ratio' (ratio of weeks to
strategies in this example).  In summary, one should exercise caution 
when interpreting the results of the Sharpe equality test: it would be
worthwhile to compare the results against a `Monte Carlo null' as illustrated
here.
