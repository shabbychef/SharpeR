Title: Statistical Significance of the Sharpe Ratio
BugReports: https://github.com/shabbychef/SharpeR/issues
Description: A collection of tools for analyzing significance of assets,
    funds, and trading strategies, based on the Sharpe ratio and overfit 
    of the same. Provides density, distribution, quantile and random generation 
    of the Sharpe ratio distribution based on normal returns, as well
    as the optimal Sharpe ratio over multiple assets. Computes confidence intervals
    on the Sharpe and provides a test of equality of Sharpe ratios based on 
    the Delta method.
