\title{Stock Returns Data}
\format{An \code{xts} object with 4777 observations and 4 columns. 

The columns are the daily log returns for the tickers IBM, AAPL, SPY and XOM, 
as sourced from Yahoo finance using the \code{quantmod} package.
Daily returns span from January, 2000 through December, 2018.  
Returns are \sQuote{log returns}, which are the differences of the logs of
daily adjusted closing price series, as defined by Yahoo finance (thus presumably
including adjustments for splits and dividends). Dates of observations are
the date of the second close defining the return, not the first.}
